To help with common questions, I've prepared supplemental material for some of the units.

Successful students in the Introduction to Data Science (DS1) course treat the course like any college-level class. They block out time in their schedule and prioritize classwork over going out, working extra hours at their day job, and Netflix. It's important to have downtime and take care of yourself; also block out that time, but don't sacrifice study time just because this is a self-paced course.

Start off right by using Springboard's [study plan tool](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/study-plan) to figure out how many hours you need to block out each week. You can also access the tool from the [curriculum page](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science/learn/#/curriculum/). Block out your study time on your calendar. Then figure in an extra one to two weeks at the end of the course to account for the unexpected.

**[Cheatsheets](Cheatsheets.md)** are a great way to quickly find the functions you need to solve problems. You can find a use for most of these in this course.

**[Unit 1: Welcome!](DS1_supplement_U1.md)**: this page offers links that provide a nice overview of the methods of data science, and some insights and public data sources for your capstone project.

**[Unit 2: Programming in R](DS1_supplement_U2.md)**: I provide a bunch of material that is largely missing from the curriculum, but often trips up students, including understanding different types of data; the assignment operators in R; subsetting data frames and extracting data from them; installing R and RStudio; setting up Git, setting up GitHub and connecting RStudio to GitHub.

*There are also additional practice problems that I ask students attempt at the end of Unit 2.* These optional problems are a good way for you to practice the skills taught in Unit 2, and provide us a chance to improve your proficiency.

**[Unit 3: Data Wrangling](DS1_supplement_U3.md)** Data Wrangling: Alternative resources for learning data wrangling, with exercises to supplement Data Camp.

<div style="margin-top:10px; margin-left:50px; margin-right:20px; font-style:italic">80% of a data scientist's time is spent wrangling data.</div>

<div style="margin-top:10px; margin-left:50px; margin-right:20px; font-style:italic">80% of the time importing data is boring and tedious, and then 20% of the time it's just endless screaming.</div>

**Unit 5: Probability and Descriptive Statistics**: The most important data science lesson you won't learn in this class: sample size and power. While the sexy, public face of data science is often revolves around large data sets, in the real world, we are often working with very limited data. How much data you have in each sub-group in an analysis greatly impacts the uncertainty in your analyses, and therefore the risk in decisions based on your analysis.

In a series of blog posts focused on using designed experiments to solve a common product design problem, I provide an introduction to sample size, power, and how important these often-overlooked factors are to effective analysis. The considerations are equally applicable to observational studies such as data collected from users, traffic incidents, crime, or sports.

* [Part 2: Uncertainty in Measurement](https://tomhopper.me/2014/11/21/sample-size-matters-uncertainty-in-measurement/)
* [Part 3: Design and Experiments](https://tomhopper.me/2014/11/28/sample-size-matters-design-and-experiments/)
* [Part 4: Design and Cost](https://tomhopper.me/2014/12/05/sample-size-matters-design-and-cost/)

**[Unit 6: Data Story](DS1_supplement_U6.md)**: More on the data story, how to write a technical report, and further resources for presentations.

**[Unit 7: Introduction to Machine Learning](DS1_supplement_U7.md)**: The missing lesson: intro to time series.

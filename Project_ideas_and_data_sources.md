# Foundations Capstone Project Ideas and Data Sources

## Examples

Springboard provides [videos of past capstone project presentations](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjKxfZpleE6B-e6hDQ4m7Yrs7s9HIoZZs) via Office Hours Thursdays. 

I did a simple R interactive data exploration of [crime in Michigan](https://tomhopper.shinyapps.io/MI_50_Safest_cities/). Not quite at the level of a capstone project, but it contains most of the elements of a good project.

## Project ideas (entry level):

These pre-packaged projects are good for the Foundations capstone project, and come with defined goals, scope and available data.

* [Five data science projects to learn data science](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/11/data-science-projects-learn/)
* [Crowdanalytix](https://www.crowdanalytix.com/), One platform for crowdsourcing & deploying AI at scale
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) Your home for data science
* [Data Sources for Cool Data Science Projects: Part 1](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-1/)
* [Data Sources for Cool Data Science Projects: Part 2](http://blog.thedataincubator.com/2014/10/data-sources-for-cool-data-science-projects-part-2/)

## Data-access packages:

> (See [These R packages import sports weather stock data and more](http://www.computerworld.com/article/3109890/data-analytics/these-r-packages-import-sports-weather-stock-data-and-more.html) for explanation of some of these packages.)

Unless otherwise noted, packages are available from CRAN.
